     <div class="about"><p>
            
            This project, built by Farkhondeh Shahbazi for Code The Dream's advanced course, is a website to help coffee fans find their ideal brew.
            </p>
            <P>What it Does:</P>
            <p>
            Find Hot or Iced Coffee: Choose between hot and iced coffee options.
            Filter by Ingredients: Search for coffees with your favorite ingredients to discover new flavors you'll love.
            Learn About Each Coffee: Get details on each coffee, like its name, type, ingredients, and even a picture.
            Easy Browsing: Large datasets are broken down into smaller pages (pagination) for easier scrolling.
            </p>        
            <P>How it Works:</P>

            <p>I use the "Coffee Lover" API to get information about different coffees.
            The website adjusts to different screen sizes (responsive design).
            Buttons, checkboxes, and page navigation make it easy to interact with the website.
            </p>    
            <p>Pages:</p>

            <p>Main Page: Choose hot or iced coffee, or search for your favorite.</p>
            <p>Hot Coffee Page: See a list of all hot coffees with details and page navigation.</p>
            <p>Iced Coffee Page: See a list of all iced coffees with details and page navigation.</p>
            <p>Search Page: Pick your coffee type (hot or iced) and choose your favorite ingredients. Click search to see coffees that match your choices.</p>
            <p>coffee.js: This file contains the main code for getting data, handling user clicks, and showing information on the pages.</p>
